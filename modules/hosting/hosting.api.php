 * to it, but you should avoid changing things outside of the
 * $task->content_options collection.

 * @param $task

 *   these changes won't persist in the backend unless you have a service that
 *   will store them.

 *   verified is available in the $task->ref property.

/**
 * Act on nodes defined by other modules.

 * hook you should replace TYPE with the node type and OP with the node
 * operation you would like to be notified for. A list of possible values for OP
 * can be found in the documentation for hook_nodeapi().
 *
 * This hook may help you write code that is easier to follow, but this is an
 * hosting specific hook so you may confuse other developers that are not so
 * familar with the internals of hosting.
 *
 * @param &$node
 *   The node the action is being performed on.
 * @param $a3
 *   - When OP is "view", passes in the $teaser parameter from node_view().
 *   - When OP is "validate", passes in the $form parameter from node_validate().
 * @param $a4
 *   - When OP is "view", passes in the $page parameter from node_view().
 * @return
 *   This varies depending on the operation (OP).
 *   - The "presave", "insert", "update", "delete", "print" and "view"
 *     operations have no return value.
 *   - The "load" operation should return an array containing pairs
 *     of fields => values to be merged into the node object.
